Hello!

This repository is being used to store code created during my online lessons of learning different languages. Currently the focus is on HTML/CSS/JS - for which I am adequately comfortable with HTML and CSS.
I am still getting used to the JS aspect of web page development, but as they say, practice makes perfect. I am also not an expert in using GitHub so please excuse the disorganization/lack of professionalism when it comes to Github.


Will be uploading various projects in this repository under different folder names.
